## Reflections

My full regards for every one. Much food for thought are provided by both lectures and homeworks(actually the version of lectures i have managed to follow was [18.S191 MIT Fall 2020](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6Q2Kr16aWPOKE0dz9OnsnIJ)). Many courses I took before seems in eclipse, and I have never ever taken such a intriguing introductory course like this, from where, I truly believe, you can go anywhere. 

Here are the topics that I truly admire:
1. Convolutions and Mathematics(Laplacian, Sobel)
2. Seam Carving using Dynamic Programming
3. SIR Model on Discrete & Continuous  Stepping and Event Awareness, Monte-Carlo and Probability 
4. Recursion and Hierarchic & Cascadic Thinking
5. Machine Learning
6. ......
